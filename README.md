# Line-Follower-Robot

The aim of the project is to design and develop a robust line follower robot that can navigate on a black line over a white background autonomously. This report provides deep understanding and detailed discussion of the systematic procedure implemented to successfully complete the project. In this project, a system engineering approach is executed. Systems engineering consists of a collaborative approach towards the development of an interdisciplinary and complex system. Often customer satisfaction is neglected in designing solutions, however the concept of systems engineering is to derive a customer driven product through continuous evaluation and feedback. The project begins with defining a problem statement which is derived from the stakeholder needs. Throughout the project, various phases are completed and reviewed to ensure the customer requirements are being satisfied. The four main stages present in a system engineering project are: Identification of need, preliminary design, detailed design, and manufacturing. After the completion of each stage, the outputs are compared with the stakeholder requirements and needs to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. Finally, the different needs and functions of the line follower robot are identified by applying systems engineering and accordingly prioritized so as to obtain the best result and output from the system.
